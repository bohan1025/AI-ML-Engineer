# AI vs Human Text Classification

A comprehensive machine learning project comparing multiple approaches for distinguishing between human-written and AI-generated text across different domains.

## Project Overview

This project implements and compares various machine learning models to classify text as either human-written or AI-generated. The study focuses on domain adaptation and cross-domain generalization capabilities of different approaches.

## Key Features
