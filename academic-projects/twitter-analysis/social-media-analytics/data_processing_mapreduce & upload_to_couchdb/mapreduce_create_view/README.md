# View Creation on the database
The view creation file doesn't need to run in order
but it need to ensure that you have your secenario realted database in the couchdb,
if you have those database in your CouchDB, it would be free to run the following command
```
python filename.py
```
change filename.py with the file you want to run
Note: the `createViewForMastodon.py`  should need you have a database that store the Mastodon Stream data
